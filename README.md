# minigrid-rl-experiments

Reinforcement learning experiments using MiniGrid environments, developed as part of the Statistical Planning and Reinforcement Learning module

## Project Overview

This project has two parts:

### Part 1: Frozen Lake
Implementation of core RL algorithms on the Frozen Lake environment:
- Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration
- Tabular Sarsa and Q-Learning
- Linear function approximation (Sarsa and Q-Learning)
- Deep Q-Network (DQN)

### Part 2: Beyond Frozen Lake
Custom experiments using MiniGrid environments to explore RL challenges such as:
- Sample efficiency
- Partial observability
- Sparse rewards
- Exploration strategies

## Setup
```bash
pip install gymnasium minigrid numpy torch
```
